# Excel VBA–Based E-Commerce MIS & Sales Analytics Project

## Project Summary

This project focuses on building an end-to-end **Management Information System (MIS)** and **sales analytics solution** using **Microsoft Excel and VBA**, based on a realistic e-commerce dataset. The objective was to automate data preparation, KPI calculation, MIS reporting, and analytical pivot tables to replicate real-world business reporting workflows.

The raw dataset contains order-level information such as customer details, product attributes, pricing, discounts, quantity, ratings, delivery status, payment methods, and geographic data. Multiple worksheets were structured to ensure a clear separation between raw data, cleaned data, calculated KPIs, MIS summaries, and analytical outputs.

Using **VBA macros**, the raw data was cleaned and standardized by handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and normalizing delivery status fields. Additional **derived business metrics** were created, including Gross Sales, Net Sales, Discount Amount, and Order Flags (Completed, Returned, Cancelled), ensuring accurate revenue calculations based on numeric quantity fields.

A dedicated **MIS Summary sheet** was developed to automatically calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Rating, Delivered/Returned/Cancelled percentages, and Top Brand by Revenue. These KPIs were computed using loop-based VBA logic and dictionary objects to ensure accuracy, scalability, and robustness without relying solely on worksheet formulas.

To support deeper analysis, Pivot Tables were created to analyze revenue and performance across multiple dimensions, including Category-wise Revenue, Brand-wise Revenue, City-wise Revenue, Order Status Distribution, and Payment Method Analysis.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical expertise in Excel automation, VBA programming, data validation, MIS reporting, and business analytics, closely aligning with real corporate reporting and analyst requirements.
